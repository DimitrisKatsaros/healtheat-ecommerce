## Introduction

This project is a hands-on exploration of building a simple yet functional e-commerce application. Created for training purposes, my goal is to get a practical learning experience about the fundamentals of developing a full stack application.

## Credit

This project was made possible by following the **Full Stack: Angular and Java Spring Boot E-Commerce Website** course available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-angular-spring-boot-tutorial/). Special thanks to the instructors, Chad Darby and Harinath Kuntamukkala, for the comprehensive and instructive content.

I highly recommend checking out the original course for an in-depth understanding of the concepts covered here. You can also check all of their courses at https://luv2code.com/.
